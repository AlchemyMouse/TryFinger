	- TryFinger was made with 5.4.21.0 but any 5.x should work

## About
A simple mod that enables V1 to perform a particularly rude gesture.
Ideal for letting off some steam or truly bullying Gabriel (you monster).
Press T to whip it out.
Swap T for whatever key you want via `ULTRAKILL/BepInEx/config/TryFinger.cfg`.

Cybergrind scores are disabled while the mod is active.
Might re-enable them once I'm confident the mod doesn't give an unfair advantage or introduce advantagueous bugs.
It shouldn't but might as well be safe.
